          <p class="mybio">Gabrielle Bremer is a student at American University in Washington, D.C. She is a journalism major with minors in graphic design, creative writing, and religious studies. She became interested in religious studies during her first semester at American when she took a class called, ‘Dying, Death, and the Afterlife,’ which examined how religion plays a huge role in how different societies think about death. Since then, Bremer has been fascinated by why people do the things they do because of their religion, and how their lives are impacted because of it. In the future, she hopes to write investigative articles on new trends happening across many religious traditions. </p>
